# Threads vs. Processes

Understanding the differences between threads and processes is fundamental to concurrent and parallel programming.

## Processes

- A process is an instance of a program executing on a computer
- It consists of the program's code, data, and state information
- Each process has its own independent address space in memory
- Computers can manage hundreds of active processes simultaneously

## Threads

- Threads are smaller, subelements that exist within a process
- They represent independent paths of execution through a program
- Threads are the basic units managed by the operating system for execution
- Multiple threads within a process share the same address space and resources

## Comparison of Processes and Threads

- Processes are isolated from each other, each with its own address space
- Threads within the same process can easily share resources and communicate
- Interprocess communication is possible but requires special mechanisms
- Threads are generally considered "lightweight" compared to processes
- Creating and terminating threads typically requires less overhead than processes
- Switching between threads of the same process is usually faster than switching between different processes

### Analogy: Cooking in the Kitchen

- A process is likened to a kitchen (address space) where cooking occurs
- Threads are represented by cooks working on different tasks within the same kitchen
- Different processes are compared to separate kitchens working on distinct meals

## Choosing between Threads and Processes

- The choice depends on the specific task and operating environment
- Threads are generally recommended when possible due to their lightweight nature
- Implementing threads and processes can vary across operating systems and programming languages
