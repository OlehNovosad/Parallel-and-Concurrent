# Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms

Divide-and-conquer algorithms break down complex problems into smaller, manageable subproblems. They are well suited for parallel execution across multiple processors.

A divide-and-conquer algorithm is structured in three parts:

- **Divide:** The main problem is split into smaller subproblems of roughly equal size
- **Conquer:** Each subproblem is solved recursively
- **Combine:** Solutions to subproblems are merged to form the final solution

Barron and Olivia demonstrate the divide-and-conquer approach using an array of shopping receipts to calculate total spending.

- **Sequential approach:** Iterating through receipts and accumulating values
- **Parallel approach:** Dividing receipts among multiple processors for simultaneous calculation, then combining results

## Recursive Division Process

Problems can be continuously subdivided until reaching a defined base case:

- The base case may be individual elements or a threshold amount, depending on the algorithm
- After reaching the base case, subgroup results are combined as the recursion unwinds
- In code, this is often implemented using an `if-else` structure

- **Base case:** When the problem is small enough to solve directly
- **Recursive case:** Divides the problem into "left" and "right" subproblems, solves them recursively, then combines the results

## Advantages

- Subproblems are independent, allowing for parallel execution on different processors
- Can significantly reduce computation time for large datasets

## Considerations

- Not all divide-and-conquer algorithms benefit from parallelization
- The overhead of parallelization must be weighed against potential performance gains
- Factors to consider include problem size and operational complexity
