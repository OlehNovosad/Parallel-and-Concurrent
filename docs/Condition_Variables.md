# Limitations of Locks and Mutexes

A lock or mutex restricts multiple threads from accessing a shared resource simultaneously; however, it doesn't provide a way for threads to signal each other or synchronize actions efficiently.

# Condition Variables

Condition variables serve as a queue for threads waiting for a specific condition to occur. They work in conjunction with mutexes to implement a higher-level construct called a **monitor**.

## Monitors

Monitors protect critical sections of code with mutual exclusion and provide mechanisms for threads to wait and be notified.

Barron and Olivia describe the concept of monitors using a room analogy:

- The monitor is like a room containing protected procedures and shared data
- The mutex acts as a lock on the door
- Condition variables are like waiting rooms outside the monitor

## Condition Variable Operations

There are three main operations associated with condition variables:

- **Wait**: Releases the mutex lock and puts the thread to sleep in a queue
- **Signal** (or notify/wake): Wakes up a single thread from the waiting queue
- **Broadcast** (or notifyAll/wakeAll): Wakes up all threads in the waiting queue

## Practical Application

One common use case for condition variables is implementing a shared queue or buffer, which typically involves:

- A mutex to ensure exclusive access to the queue
- Two condition variables: one for signaling when the buffer is not full (for adding items) and another for signaling when the buffer is not empty (for removing items)

# Summary

Condition variables enable efficient thread synchronization by allowing threads to wait for specific conditions and signal each other when those conditions are met
This mechanism improves upon simple mutex-based solutions by reducing “busy-waiting” and enabling more sophisticated coordination between threads
