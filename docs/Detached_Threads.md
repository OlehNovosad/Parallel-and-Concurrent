# Background Tasks (Detached Threads)

Threads are often created to provide services or perform periodic tasks in support of the main program. A common example of such a service is garbage collection, which runs in the background to manage memory automatically.

## Garbage Collection

- Garbage collection is an automatic memory management technique that reclaims memory that is no longer in use by the program
- Many programming languages include garbage collection as part of their runtime environment

## Independent Execution of Threads

- The garbage collection thread (represented by Olivia in the video) executes independently of the main thread
- This allows the main program to continue its tasks while garbage collection occurs concurrently

## Normal Child Threads

- When spawned as a normal child thread, the garbage collection thread prevents the main program from exiting
- This is because the main thread must wait for all of its non-daemon child threads to terminate before it can exit
- Continuous background tasks like garbage collection may run indefinitely, causing the program to never terminate

## Daemon Threads

- A daemon thread is a background thread that does not prevent the program from exiting when it's still running
- By default, new threads are spawned as non-daemon (normal) threads and must be explicitly set as daemon threads

## Benefits of Daemon Threads

- Daemon threads allow the main program to exit even if the daemon threads are still running
- When the main thread finishes and no non-daemon threads are left, the process can terminate

## Cautions When Daemon Threads Terminate

- Daemon threads are abruptly terminated when the process exits, so they do not have the opportunity to gracefully shut down
- Abrupt termination is generally safe for tasks like garbage collection; however, for I/O operations (for example, writing to a file), abrupt termination may lead to data corruption
- When detaching a thread to run as a daemon background task, consider the potential negative side effects of it being abruptly terminated
