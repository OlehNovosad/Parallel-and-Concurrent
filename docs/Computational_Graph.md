# Computational Graphs

Computational graphs model relationships between program steps. Graphs visualize which steps can be executed in parallel to help coordinate parallel execution and identify dependencies.

## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

- **Nodes** represent tasks or units of work
- **Directed edges** indicate progression and dependencies between tasks

> Barron illustrates the concept of a computational graph using a salad-making process, which involves chopping lettuce, chopping tomatoes, mixing the ingredients, and adding salad dressing.

- Chopping lettuce and tomatoes can occur asynchronously
- **Spawn** node represents the start of parallel execution
- **Sync** node ensures both chopping tasks complete before mixing

## Key Terminology

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Spawn / Fork** | Initiates parallel execution paths |
| **Sync / Join** | Synchronizes completion of parallel tasks |
| **Asynchronous** | Tasks that can occur in any order relative to each other |
| **Critical path** | Longest sequence of dependent operations in the graph |

## Analyzing Parallel Potential

- **Work**: Total execution time on a single processor (sum of all task times)
- **Span**: Shortest possible execution time with maximum parallelization (sum of critical path times)
- **Ideal parallelism**: Ratio of work to span, indicating maximum speed improvement
